<p>So basically, it's a minimal effort blog, powered by text files. The whole fucking thing can go in svn, and when you want to modify the functionality/include any extra shit you can, 'cause it's just HTML.</p>
<p>Sure, you're free to put whatever bullcrap HTML you want into your blog posts, which might be considered poor form, but it's your blog and if you want to fuck it in the ass and see every subsequent post marqueeing all over the shop then knock yourself out.</p>
<p>Twitter provides all the interaction you could ever desire.</p>
